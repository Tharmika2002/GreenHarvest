# 🌱 GreenHarvest – Food & Waste Management Solutions

## 📖 Project Overview
**GreenHarvest** is an integrated digital platform designed to address two major challenges:  
1. Supporting **local agriculture** by connecting farmers directly with consumers.  
2. Promoting **sustainability** through a smart waste management system.  

By combining an **e-marketplace** for farmers with an **IoT-enabled waste management system**, GreenHarvest empowers communities to access fresh produce, reduce middlemen costs, and ensure cleaner cities and villages.  

The project was developed as part of the **ITP (Information Technology Project)** at the **Sri Lanka Institute of Information Technology (SLIIT)**, following MERN stack development principles with a light-themed, user-friendly design.
